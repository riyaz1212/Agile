=============
What is SDLC 
=============

=> Software development life cycle

=> It represents end to end process invovled in software development and delivery process

=> We have several phases in SDLC

	a) Requirements Gathering
	b) Requirements Analysis
	c) Design / Planning
	d) Development
	e) Testing
	f) Deployment
	g) Delivery
	h) Maintenence (SLA)


=> There are several SDLC methodologies available in the market

	Ex: Waterfall model, Agile model

================
Waterfall Model
================

=> Waterfall is the first SDLC methodology came into market

=> Waterfall model is a sequential / linear model

=> In waterfall model after one stage is completed then only we can go for next stage

=> In waterfall model we will move only in forward direction

=> Requirements are fixed and budget is also fixed

=> Client involment is very less in waterfall model

=> Client will see the project only at the end

Note: If client is not happy with our project develivery then it is time waste and money waste process.


==============
Agile Model
==============

=> Agile is an iterative approach to develop and deliver application to client

=> In Agile methodology, planning + development + testing + deployment is a continuos process

=> Application will be delivered to client in multiple releases (Sprints)

=> For every release we will take client feedback.

=> Client involvment is very high in Agile methodology

=> Requirements, Duration and Budget is not fixed

==================
Agile team
==================

a) Product Owner : Responsible for project deliverables

b) Scrum Master : Responsible to manage Agile team members work

c) Tech Lead : Seniour resource to solve technical challenges

d) Team Members : Developers + Testers will be there

==================
Agile Terminology
==================

a) backlog grooming : A meeting to identify pending tasks in the project

b) story : A task that we have to work on (every story will have story-id)

c) story points : Represents duration to complete the story
	
			3 points: 1 day
			5 points : 2 days
			8 points : 3 days

d) sprint planning : A meeting to pritorize the backlog stories to work in next sprint based on team band width.

e) sprint : Fixed set of stories that we agreed to complete in sprint duration.

	Sprint Duration  : 2 weeks (Industry standard)

f) scrum : Daily meeting to provide work updates to scrum master.

			a) What are you working on ?
			b) When it will complete ?
			c) Do you have any issues ?
			d) Do you need any help ?

g) Retrospective : Review meeting to discuss what went well, what went wrong, lessons learnt, improvements and new ideas....

	Note: Retrospective will happen monthly once.

=======
JIRA
=======

=> Jira software developed by Atlasian company

=> JIRA will be used as project management tool

=> Using JIRA we can perform below activities

	a) Creating tasks (Stories)
	b) Assigning tasks
	c) Bug Reporting
	d) Project Status reports etc...

=> We can practice JIRA using trail version.


=========================================================

Each Team Member should give 3 points per day

10 days sprint * 3 points = 30 points for each member

total_team_size (10) * 30 = 300 points (Sprint goal)
